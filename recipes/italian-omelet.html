        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>An Italian Omelet with goat cheese</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>3 eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon crumbled goat cheese</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons chopped chives divided</li>
            <li>Sea salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat, swirling oil to coat the skillet. Pour eggs into hot skillet; eggs will bubble and firm immediately.</li>
            <li>Lift cooked edges of the omelet with a rubber spatula and tilt the skillet so that the uncooked egg runs underneath the lifted edge. Continue cooking, lifting edges and tilting the skillet, until omelet is almost completely set, 1 to 2 minutes total cooking time; remove from heat. Spread out any runny egg evenly on the top of the omelet with a rubber spatula.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle goat cheese, 1 1/2 teaspoons chives, sea salt, and black pepper over omelet. Gently lift one edge and fold 1/3 of the omelet into the center over the cheese and chives. Fold the opposite 1/3 of the omelet into the center. Slide omelet to the edge of the skillet and flip, folded side down, onto a plate. Top with remaining chives.</li>
        </ol>
